- 👋 Hi, I’m @An5189
- 👀 I’m interested in Family, Computer Science, Art, and Bushiness.
- 🌱 I’m currently taking Hadrvards CS50 course through their Open Learning program on Edx. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with others taking this course or another Beginner CS50 course. I started this same course awhile back and didn't get past the first week because I was intimidated by the "Harvard" name on it.
- ### My Programming and CS Courses
- FreeCodeCamp- Responsive Web Design Certification
- FreeCodeCamp Legacy of Python Certification
- Harvards-Intro to CS Course: CS50x and CS50p
- PY4E-Python For Everyone is the book I'm reading/interactive learning from. 
  
- David Malan and Chuck Severence have found a way to teach me, a grandmother with no CS background, Computer Science and Programming.  
- ## How to reach me:
- 📫 Email me kayleeesmawmaw@gmail.com
- <a rel="me" href="https://mstdn.social/@an5189">Mastodon</a>
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am 47 years old, a SINGLE grandmother of 4 and mother of 3 adult sons.
