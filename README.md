- 👋 Hi, I’m @An5189
- 👀 I’m interested in Family, Computer Science, Art, and Bushiness.
- 🌱 I’m currently taking Hadrvards CS50 course through their Open Learning program on Edx. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with others taking this course or another Beginner CS50 course. I started this same
- course awhile back and didn't get past the first week because I was intimidated by the "Harvard" name on it.
- After trying a few more and not getting far I came back to the Harvard one. The professor makes is amazing. Hes found
- a way to teach me, a grandmother with no CS background, Computer Science.  
- 📫 How to reach me..Email me @ kayleeesmawmaw@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am 47 years old, a SINGLE grandmother of 4 and mother of 3 adult sons.
